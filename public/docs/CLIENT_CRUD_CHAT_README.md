# Client CRUD via AI Chat

This document explains how to use the client CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality through the AI chat interface.

## Overview

The AI chat system now supports natural language commands for managing clients. When you're in a chat session, you can use conversational commands to create, view, update, and delete client records.

## Supported Commands

### Create Client

**Examples:**
- "Create a new client named John Smith with email john@example.com"
- "Add a client called Jane Doe, email is jane@example.com, phone is 555-1234"
- "New client: Bob Wilson from ABC Company, email bob@abc.com"

**Extracted Data:**
- Name (first and last name)
- Email address
- Phone number (optional)
- Company name (optional)

### Read/View Client

**Examples:**
- "Show client John Smith"
- "Find client john@example.com"
- "Get client details for Jane Doe"
- "Who is Bob Wilson?"

**Search Methods:**
- By full name
- By email address
- By company name

### List Clients

**Examples:**
- "List all clients"
- "Show all clients"
- "Get client directory"
- "List active clients"
- "Show clients in technology industry"

**Filters:**
- Status (active/inactive)
- Industry
- Search term

### Update Client

**Examples:**
- "Update client John Smith's email to newemail@example.com"
- "Change client phone to 555-9999"
- "Modify client company to New Company Inc"

### Delete Client

**Examples:**
- "Delete client John Smith"
- "Remove client john@example.com"
- "Delete client record for Jane Doe"

## How It Works

1. **Intent Detection**: The system analyzes your message to detect client-related intents
2. **Data Extraction**: Relevant information is extracted from your message
3. **Service Call**: The appropriate client service method is called
4. **Response Formatting**: Results are formatted into a natural language response

## Confidence Threshold

The system uses a confidence threshold of 0.7 (70%) to determine if a message is a client CRUD command. If the confidence is below this threshold, the message is processed as a regular AI chat message.

## Error Handling

- **Missing Information**: If required information is missing, the system will ask for clarification
- **Client Not Found**: If a client doesn't exist, a clear error message is provided
- **Duplicate Email**: If trying to create a client with an existing email, the system will inform you
- **Invalid Data**: Invalid data formats are handled gracefully with helpful error messages

## Examples

### Successful Client Creation
```
User: "Create a new client named Sarah Johnson with email sarah@techcorp.com and phone 555-1234"
AI: "Client Sarah Johnson created successfully.

Client Details:
- Name: Sarah Johnson
- Email: sarah@techcorp.com
- Phone: 555-1234
- ID: 123"
```

### Successful Client Lookup
```
User: "Show client sarah@techcorp.com"
AI: "Found client: Sarah Johnson

Client Information:
- Name: Sarah Johnson
- Email: sarah@techcorp.com
- Phone: 555-1234
- Created: Jan 15, 2024"
```

### Client Not Found
```
User: "Show client nonexistent@example.com"
AI: "Client not found with identifier: nonexistent@example.com"
```

## Technical Implementation

The client CRUD functionality is implemented through:

1. **IntentDetectionService**: Analyzes messages for client-related intents
2. **ClientService**: Handles all client database operations
3. **AIChatService**: Integrates the intent detection and client operations
4. **Natural Language Processing**: Extracts structured data from conversational input

## Testing

Run the tests to verify functionality:

```bash
php artisan test tests/Feature/ClientCRUDChatTest.php
```

## Future Enhancements

- Support for more complex queries
- Bulk operations
- Advanced filtering options
- Integration with other entities (projects, proposals, etc.)
- Voice command support
